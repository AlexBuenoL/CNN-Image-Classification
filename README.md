# CNN-Image-Classification
This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for binary image classification, specifically detecting whether a person in an image is smiling. Implemented in Python with PyTorch, it involves:

- **Dataset Handling**: Preprocessing includes dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test subsets and exploring feature separability using PCA and t-SNE.
- **CNN Model Design**: Custom CNN architectures are created with hyperparameter tuning, exploring variations in the number of layers, kernel sizes, pooling strategies, batch normalization, and dropout regularization.
- **Training and Optimization**: Training loops are implemented with early stopping to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: The best models are identified based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project highlights the impact of different hyperparameter combinations on the model's ability to generalize, providing valuable insights into effective CNN design for image classification tasks.
